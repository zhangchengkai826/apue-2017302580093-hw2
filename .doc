### Design ###
1. Group commands with similar functionalities together.
   e.g. -t -u -c are implemented together.
2. Use compare functions as parameters to reduce redundancy.
3. Implement my own variable length array data structure.

### Test ###
Run "make test" or "./test.sh"
You can also directly check the test output generated on my computer in test.out
